_Resilient Chicago_ seeks to address the city’s key challenges – experienced disproportionately by vulnerable populations on the social, economic, and geographic margins of the city – by promoting connection among residents, neighborhoods, institutions, and government. This strategy focuses on the advancement of concrete, outcome-oriented initiatives that will help create a more Connected Chicago. The strategy is supported by three resilience pillars: Strong Neighborhoods, Robust Infrastructure, and Prepared Communities. These areas were prioritized as each one is critical to the resilience of the city, requires broad-based support, and demands a comprehensive approach.

* *Pillar 1: Strong Neighborhoods.* Ensure every resident in every neighborhood has the access and opportunity to participate in the economic future of Chicago.
* *Pillar 2: Robust Infrastructure.* Connect infrastructure investments to strategies that create economic opportunity for all Chicagoans and enhance quality of life for vulnerable communities.
* *Pillar 3: Prepared Communities.* Ensure that Chicagoans are engaged and informed so that they are prepared for all threats they face now and in the future.

Our city is already on the path to progress with respect to creating a more Connected Chicago. Yet there is a long way to go on the road ahead. Chicago’s future is connected to the actions its residents, government, and other partners take today. By building urban resilience now, Chicago will draw closer to a future that is less susceptible to the stresses and shocks that it faces. With this strategy, the City is committed to building a more resilient Chicago, together.
