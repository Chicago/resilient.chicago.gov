 ## Letter from the Resilient Chicago Steering Committee

It has been an honor to witness the evolution and participate in the development of Resilient Chicago, and we are excited to play an active role in shaping how this strategy will come to life over the coming years. Together we represent thirty-seven different public, private, non-profit, and philanthropic organizations. We have provided input according to our expertise and passion, shared insight from our experiences, and offered guidance on the direction of the strategy to address the most pressing challenges facing Chicagoans today and into the future. 
With Mayor Emanuel’s announcement that he will not seek another term, there will be new leadership at City Hall. As members of the Steering Committee, we feel it is important for the City to commit to continued implementation of the strategy through the leadership transition. From the earliest conversations with Chicagoans expressing their needs to the latter stages of identifying initiatives to meet these needs, we believe the final strategy presents an opportunity to strengthen Chicago on several critical fronts.
The various initiatives outlined in the strategy will continue to be advanced by City departments and agencies such as the Office of Emergency Management and Communication (OEMC), Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT), and the Department of Water Management (DWM). In addition, our Committee members, including the Metropolitan Planning Council (MPC), the Sierra Club, and Commonwealth Edison (ComEd) will carry on key collaborations with City departments to implement the strategy. In addition to the groups mentioned above, all entities involved in the Steering Committee are committed to ensuring the strategy’s successful implementation by sharing its vision with our platforms, continuing conversations amongst the Committee, and engaging other organizations and community members to support its implementation. 
We are proud to be a part of the City’s effort to address Chicago’s challenges through strengthening existing initiatives and forming new connections. The strategy provides a framework for improving Chicago’s resilience for years to come, and we look forward to continuing the work together. 
Sincerely,
The Resilient Chicago Steering Committee
